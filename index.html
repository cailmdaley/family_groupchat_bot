<h2>Making a family bot</h2>
<p>In lieu of actually useful Christmas gifts, I decided to make a “Markov chain” bot that generates quotes based on the history of our family group chat. When trained on a particular body of text, <a href="https://github.com/jsvine/markovify">Markov chain models</a> learn which words are likely to appear next to each other and then use this information to string words into semi-coherent sentences. People use Markov chain models to make twitter bots all the time (<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/09/-horse-ebooks-is-the-most-successful-piece-of-cyber-fiction-ever/279946/">@horse_ebooks</a> is probably the most famous), so I thought it might be fun to try the tool on our family group chat!</p>

<h2>So who did the bot learn from?</h2>
<p>(the more texts a person sends, the more the bot will learn their texting style)</p>
